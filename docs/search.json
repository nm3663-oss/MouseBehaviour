    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nFor this project, I chose to study mouse behavior using pose-tracking data collected at Columbia University Medical Center’s lab. We recorded ten videos of freely moving mice and tracked several key body parts using DeepLabCut. Two of these mice were part of an experimental (stressed) condition, and the remaining eight were controls. Our main interest is to understand whether early behavioral differences can be detected automatically before more obvious symptoms appear. In other words, can we find subtle posture or movement patterns that distinguish experimental mice from controls? To explore this, I focused on descriptive analysis and visualization. I examined data quality, compared spatial behavior across mice, and used clustering to identify recurring posture states. My goal was not prediction, but discovery: to see whether distinct patterns emerge that could later help identify early signs of brain or stress-related disorders.",

    "text": "2.1 Technical description\nThe dataset contains tracking outputs from ten videos of mice placed individually in the same circular arena. Each frame includes x/y coordinates and likelihood values for several body parts: nose, ears, head area, tail base, and tail tip. Videos are around 45,000–51,000 frames each (roughly 25–28 minutes at 30 fps).\nAll tracking files were collected directly from our lab’s DeepLabCut pipeline.\nOverall, the data are consistent in format and length across videos, which makes them easy to compare. The only issue was that likelihood for the tail tip was sometimes lower than other body parts, which is common in freely moving animals. Aside from that, the data quality was high.\nRows: 468,102\nColumns: 24\n$ bodyparts_coords       &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 1…\n$ Light_x                &lt;dbl&gt; 838.6320, 839.3212, 839.7064, 842.3026, 845.332…\n$ Light_y                &lt;dbl&gt; 549.5389, 549.8290, 549.8290, 549.5389, 548.463…\n$ Light_likelihood       &lt;dbl&gt; 0.03178143, 0.02934040, 0.03336119, 0.02417329,…\n$ Nose_x                 &lt;dbl&gt; 856.0997, 856.0997, 856.2988, 856.2988, 856.982…\n$ Nose_y                 &lt;dbl&gt; 543.5959, 543.5959, 543.5959, 542.4019, 541.614…\n$ Nose_likelihood        &lt;dbl&gt; 0.9898987, 0.9870993, 0.9825415, 0.9607392, 0.9…\n$ `Tail Base_x`          &lt;dbl&gt; 781.8240, 781.8240, 781.9657, 781.9657, 781.965…\n$ `Tail Base_y`          &lt;dbl&gt; 510.1070, 510.4549, 510.7815, 513.2952, 516.441…\n$ `Tail Base_likelihood` &lt;dbl&gt; 0.9902473, 0.9896467, 0.9900921, 0.9934571, 0.9…\n$ `Tail TIp_x`           &lt;dbl&gt; 738.7238, 738.7238, 738.7238, 738.7238, 738.723…\n$ `Tail TIp_y`           &lt;dbl&gt; 462.0266, 462.1000, 462.2083, 463.1281, 464.436…\n$ `Tail TIp_likelihood`  &lt;dbl&gt; 0.9750594, 0.9725831, 0.9637877, 0.9713903, 0.9…\n$ headarea_x             &lt;dbl&gt; 838.7948, 839.5037, 840.0235, 842.3242, 844.661…\n$ headarea_y             &lt;dbl&gt; 545.5502, 545.5502, 545.5502, 545.2851, 545.285…\n$ headarea_likelihood    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.9974886, 0.9966859, 0.9971533, 0.9958277, 0.9…\n$ leftear_x              &lt;dbl&gt; 837.8909, 838.4118, 838.9759, 841.1564, 843.984…\n$ leftear_y              &lt;dbl&gt; 537.8688, 537.8688, 537.8688, 537.8688, 537.868…\n$ leftear_likelihood     &lt;dbl&gt; 0.9176812, 0.9084605, 0.9133146, 0.8804448, 0.8…\n$ rightear_x             &lt;dbl&gt; 835.9253, 837.0594, 837.4548, 841.0958, 843.624…\n$ rightear_y             &lt;dbl&gt; 554.3290, 554.3290, 554.3290, 553.9014, 553.901…\n$ rightear_likelihood    &lt;dbl&gt; 0.9118637, 0.9150730, 0.9345577, 0.9217122, 0.9…\n$ video_id               &lt;chr&gt; \"Video01_f_c_c6_red.csv\", \"Video01_f_c_c6_red.c…\n$ frame                  &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, …",

When I plotted average nose location for: all mice combined, control mice only, and experimental mice only, all three points were almost on top of each other, near the center of the arena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI then compared full posture clouds (all frames), showing where each mouse’s nose appeared in camera coordinates. Both control and experimental mice formed nearly identical “X-shaped” patterns. This shape comes from the geometry of the arena and the way mice move across it. In raw camera coordinates, experimental mice do not appear to explore the arena differently than controls. This suggests we should look deeper, at body-relative posture rather than position in space.\n\n4 Relative posture and clustering\nTo study posture itself, I converted body-part locations into a coordinate system relative to the mouse’s own head–body orientation. This removes the influence of where the mouse is in the arena and focuses on the shape and angles of the body. I then ran PCA for visualization and applied k-means clustering to group similar postures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PCA scatterplot shows that some clusters are tight and well-separated, while others are more spread out. This means: certain postures are very consistent, other postures act more like transitions between main states. The PCA plot also confirms that relative posture reveals structure that is completely invisible in raw camera coordinates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar charts show that:all videos contain all posture clusters, but the proportion of each cluster varies somewhat from mouse to mouse. Importantly, the experimental mice do not show any cluster that is completely absent in controls. Instead, they may differ in how much time they spend in certain states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand the meaning of each cluster, I plotted the relative vertical nose position for every cluster. Clusters clearly separate into:head-up postures (higher nose values), head-down postures (lower nose values), and mid-level postures. This interpretation is helpful because it translates the clusters into something biologically meaningful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing the cluster sequence over time shows that mice switch posture very frequently. This is expected for freely moving animals exploring a new environment.\n\n\n# A tibble: 19 × 4\n   group        cluster     n          p\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;int&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Control      1           2 0.00000532\n 2 Control      2         326 0.000868  \n 3 Control      3       57458 0.153     \n 4 Control      4       33078 0.0881    \n 5 Control      5       30408 0.0809    \n 6 Control      6       53960 0.144     \n 7 Control      7       58271 0.155     \n 8 Control      8       44066 0.117     \n 9 Control      9       98078 0.261     \n10 Control      10         15 0.0000399 \n11 Experimental 2           7 0.0000763 \n12 Experimental 3       17600 0.192     \n13 Experimental 4        5992 0.0653    \n14 Experimental 5        7717 0.0841    \n15 Experimental 6       13655 0.149     \n16 Experimental 7       15505 0.169     \n17 Experimental 8        9594 0.105     \n18 Experimental 9       21636 0.236     \n19 Experimental 10          1 0.0000109 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot summarizes how often each posture cluster appears in the two groups. Noticeable differences appear in several clusters: Cluster 3 and 7 occur slightly more often in the Experimental group.Cluster 4 and 9 occur more often in Control mice. These small but consistent shifts suggest that stressed mice may bias toward certain posture states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph makes the group differences easier to interpret by showing the percent-difference directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I looked at how mice move from one posture cluster to another, both groups mostly stayed in the same posture from frame to frame, which is expected. But I did notice one small difference: the Experimental mice shifted into cluster 3 a bit more often, while the Control mice tended to move into clusters 4 and 9 more frequently. So even though the overall transition patterns look similar, the stressed mice seem to favor slightly different movement patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI also checked how long mice stay in each posture before switching. Most postures were held only briefly, but the Experimental mice tended to remain in clusters 3 and 7 a bit longer, and spent less time in clusters that look more like typical locomotion. This again hints that stress may change how mice behave moment-to-moment.",
