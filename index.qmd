# Introduction

For this project, I chose to study mouse behavior using pose-tracking data collected at Columbia University Medical Center's lab. We recorded ten videos of freely moving mice and tracked several key body parts using DeepLabCut. Two of these mice were part of an experimental (stressed) condition, and the remaining eight were controls.
Our main interest is to understand whether early behavioral differences can be detected automatically before more obvious symptoms appear. In other words, can we find subtle posture or movement patterns that distinguish experimental mice from controls?
To explore this, I focused on descriptive analysis and visualization. I examined data quality, compared spatial behavior across mice, and used clustering to identify recurring posture states. My goal was not prediction, but discovery: to see whether distinct patterns emerge that could later help identify early signs of brain or stress-related disorders.
